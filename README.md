# About myself

My best strengths are my versatility to face any project, and steep learning curve, as like as a recurrent idea of optimization and performance in all I do. Always improving myself, trying to be as much polyvalent as possible and giving birth to many personal projects on different programming languages.

I deeply think that comprehension of different languages can help you to improve your skills and knowledge to face different challenges in any specific one. Joined to the experience of being working in a word-class company, supervising dev-team’s code practices and close to the DevOps environment, makes me ready to perform in each position my profile could fit.
