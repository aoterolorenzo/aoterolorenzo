### What is exactly ComuNiBA? (final name pending)

* * *

**ComuNiBA is a basketball (NBA) online manager** based on real-life stats. Pretty similar to a Fantasy but with not exactly the same behaviour. It's more like a "[Comunio](http://www.comunio.es/)" based game. There are a market that release players every X days as auctions, where the users can place bids in order to get the player into his team. The user configures his team with the players winned in the auctions and bought to another players. Every week, depending on the points your players scored, you will gain points and money to grow up with your team. Thats the basic behaviour, but obviously there are so much features, like exchanges, sales to "computer", team and player live stats, user and team configs, league configs, etc...
