### This is ![](/assets/img/mean.png)

* * *

##### This is not just a static website. Neither a prebuild template. This is:

*   **Full MEAN Stack** development
*   Seeded by a backend with a **REST API by MongoDB + Express + Node**
*   Frontend with **Angular 6**
*   Hosted at **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**.
*   **Amazon CognitoÂ® auth system implemented** for user managing
*   Designed with **HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap by MDBootsrap**
*   **Branding** and logo design

### Why this project

* * *

I feel like I'm not a common engineer, and like I wasn't a common student. I suppose that the idea which comes to your mind tinking on a non-experienced engineer is probably the typical profile of a guy without a real knowledge of the sector as it really is or someone who knows strictly what he studied and without real understanding of the subject's contents. **I consider myself like just the opposite**, a guy who needs to have **full understanding on the roots or the basis of every subject I dive into**, who **enjoy learning on his own as much as possible**, and who **enjoy programing and computer science** in general, and **has already serious skills and knoledge of languages and subjects far away from college**. My mind is not about get to know how to solve a problem mecanically or by a random method, but **know his basis and figure out the solution**.

So I thought: **what would be the better way to show it?** to prove that skills or that way of thinking? What better way than create a full web page, from the logo and template design to the backend, with **technologies and frameworks currently in trend** and at the top of the market? MEAN, AWS, Continuous Integration, NoSQL, REST, Cognito...

That's how [aotero.com](#) born and why you can see this. **Hope you capture the feel I'm trying to show :)**
