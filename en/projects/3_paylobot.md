### What is exactly PayloBot?

* * *

Paylobot is an automation designed to get into Paylogic ticket sales (company who provide ticket queueing to festivals like Tomorrowland, Mysteryland, ADE...). This bot has been in development since 2014, and year after year has been improved and refactored as Paylogic has being improving their process with Tomorrowland auth token requirements (Amazon Cognito pool), and captchas. This bot is highly efficient and gave us access to the Tomorrowland festival (known for its difficulty and low probability in order to get tickets: around 4%) every year in a row since 2014.
