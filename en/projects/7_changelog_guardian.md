### Get your company's Developer Experience to the next level

* * *

Changelog Guardian is the tool that will completely automate your software versioning following [SemVer](https://semver.org/) and will track all its changes (or at least, those which you want to) managing a fancy Changelog within the [KeepAChangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) philosophy

This tool will universalize versioning as it will allow tracking software versions form different sources: from GitHub Releases, Git Tags, to any Artifactory, as like the changelog for mutations from sources like Jira, GitHub PR's, or just commits.

### Checkout from Gitlab
