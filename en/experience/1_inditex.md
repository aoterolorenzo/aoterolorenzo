*Torus Sofware Solutions · Full time  · ago. 2020 - dic. 2021  · Fully Remote (from La Coruña, Spain)*

Industrialization and standardization process in a multinational environment with hundreds of IT teams, **standardizing software process** and **improving effectiveness and productivity** from development to releasing, as like as develop the **tools and automations** to achieve those goals. I worked simultaneously in:

- **Leading** the team flagship tool acting as a head of development, continuing its roadmap, and giving support to the dev teams (it was the key tool in charge of versioning and tracking the changes over hundreds of artifacts from the different teams).
- The **development** of a tool to assist developers following company guidelines and best practices.
- **Contributing on team decisions** and participating in the industrialization process.

Here, I have been close not only to the company’s DevOps environment but all the development teams, learning about all their internal practices and ins and outs, as like as dealing with tech leads and PO’s guiding them through all those industrialization to our processes.
