*VMware · Full time  · 2022 -Present · Fully Remote (from La Coruña, Spain)*

MTS at the VMWare/Bitnami Content Team (part of **VMWare Tanzu**). Here I am having the opportunity to keep expanding my knowledge about the **software process** and software supply chain, this time more oriented to **high-end deployment and production environments**, with **Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm Charts**.

After spending a few months onboarding into the company's stack pipelines and working methodologies, and during a year, I’ve been one of the three responsible of create, develop, and **release new assets to BAC** (Bitnami Application Catalog) and TAC (Tanzu Application Catalog), just before start **leading a small development team** (4p) introducing a Golang internal tool (which **I have impulsed myself**) to the company for observability and triage internal pipeline issues.    
BAC and TAC assets include **compilation,** Docker containers with its related logic, including **planning and development of each own specific Kubernetes scenario and chart**, some of the assets I have introduced are Jaeger, Apache Flink, Fluent Bit and OpenSearch.

Also, I am part of the Bitnami containers and charts support team, where we provide community support and troubleshooting directly on our GitHub public repositories.
